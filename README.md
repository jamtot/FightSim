# FightSim
A very scissor, paper, rock-like text based fighter. The player battles the computer, taking turns attacking and blocking. If an attack is not blocked successfully, damage is taken. If an attack is blocked, no damage is taken, and if a counter is attempted, it will be successful. Failed counters result in further damage. It's a fight to the death.
